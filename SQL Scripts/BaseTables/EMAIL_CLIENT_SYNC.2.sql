-- 03/28/2010 Paul.  Exchange Web Services returns dates in local time, so lets store both local time and UTC time. 
-- 03/28/2010 Paul.  REMOTE_KEY does not need to be an nvarchar.  
-- 04/01/2010 Paul.  Add the MODULE_NAME so that the LastModifiedTime can be filtered by module. 
-- 04/04/2010 Paul.  Add PARENT_ID so that the LastModifiedTime can be filtered by record. 
-- 07/24/2010 Paul.  Instead of managing collation in code, it is better to change the collation on the field in the database. 
-- 08/31/2010 Paul.  The EMAILS_SYNC table was renamed to EMAIL_CLIENT_SYNC to prevent conflict with Offline Client sync tables.
