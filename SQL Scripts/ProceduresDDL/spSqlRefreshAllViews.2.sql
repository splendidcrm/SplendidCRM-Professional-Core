-- 12/16/2006 Paul.  Provide a way to disable the refresh. 
-- 08/02/2007 Paul.  We need to catch view errors as they can abort the entire procedure mid-way.
-- This error is hard to trap, so use the FMTONLY trick. 
-- http://www.developmentnow.com/g/95_2006_3_0_0_728267/Im-sure-this-is-an-easy-one--Error-trap-to-skip-over-a-bad-object-.htm
-- exec ('set fmtonly on select * from ' + @ViewName + ' where 1 = 0');
-- 08/02/2007 Paul.  Skipping invalid views is not a solution.  The solution appears to be to order the views by table name length. 
-- By compiling short views first, dependent views should work because their length is typically longer. 
-- 01/07/2008 Paul.  Filter schema by TABLE_SCHEMA to prevent compiler errors. 
-- 07/14/2010 Paul.  Some customers are encountering issues with our refresh.  So only refresh views that start with vw. 
-- 11/02/2017 Paul.  Use try/catch to allow recompile to continue after error.
