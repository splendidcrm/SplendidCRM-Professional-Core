-- 07/24/2010 Paul.  Instead of managing collation in code, it is better to change the collation on the field in the database. 
if exists (select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'APPOINTMENTS_SYNC' and COLUMN_NAME = 'REMOTE_KEY' and COLLATION_NAME = 'SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS') begin -- then
	print 'alter table APPOINTMENTS_SYNC alter column REMOTE_KEY varchar(800) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS not null';

	if exists (select * from sys.indexes where name = 'IDX_APPOINTMENTS_SYNC_REMOTE_KEY') begin -- then
		drop index IDX_APPOINTMENTS_SYNC_REMOTE_KEY on APPOINTMENTS_SYNC;

	alter table APPOINTMENTS_SYNC alter column REMOTE_KEY varchar(800) collate SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CS_AS not null;

end -- if;
GO

-- 12/19/2011 Paul.  Add SERVICE_NAME to allow multiple sync targets.

-- 01/25/2012 Paul.  Add RAW_CONTENT to better detect changes.
