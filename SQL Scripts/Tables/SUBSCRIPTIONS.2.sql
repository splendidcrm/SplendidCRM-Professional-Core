-- 10/09/2015 Paul.  A SugarCRM will not have the ASSIGNED_USER_ID field, so add it. 
if not exists (select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'SUBSCRIPTIONS' and COLUMN_NAME = 'ASSIGNED_USER_ID') begin -- then
	print 'alter table SUBSCRIPTIONS add ASSIGNED_USER_ID uniqueidentifier null';
	alter table SUBSCRIPTIONS add ASSIGNED_USER_ID uniqueidentifier null;
	update SUBSCRIPTIONS
	   set ASSIGNED_USER_ID = CREATED_BY;

	create index IDX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_USER_RECORD on dbo.SUBSCRIPTIONS (ASSIGNED_USER_ID, DELETED, PARENT_ID  )
	create index IDX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_USER_MODULE on dbo.SUBSCRIPTIONS (ASSIGNED_USER_ID, DELETED, PARENT_TYPE)
end -- if;
GO
