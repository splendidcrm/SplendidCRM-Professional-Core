-- 04/21/2008 Paul.  SugarCRM uses the field name CONTENTS and we use CONTENT. 
if not exists (select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'USER_PREFERENCES' and COLUMN_NAME = 'CONTENT') begin -- then
	if exists (select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'USER_PREFERENCES' and COLUMN_NAME = 'CONTENTS') begin -- then
		print 'alter table USER_PREFERENCES rename CONTENTS to CONTENT';
		exec sp_rename 'USER_PREFERENCES.CONTENTS', 'CONTENT', 'COLUMN';
	end -- if;
end -- if;
GO

-- 11/17/2009 Paul.  We have added DATE_MODIFIED_UTC to tables that are sync'd. 
if not exists (select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where TABLE_NAME = 'USER_PREFERENCES' and COLUMN_NAME = 'DATE_MODIFIED_UTC') begin -- then
	print 'alter table USER_PREFERENCES add DATE_MODIFIED_UTC datetime null default(getutcdate())';
	alter table USER_PREFERENCES add DATE_MODIFIED_UTC datetime null default(getutcdate());
end -- if;
GO
