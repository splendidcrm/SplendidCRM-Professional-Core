-- 04/29/2007 Paul.  Start with QUOTES, but join to INVOICES_CSTM as the order page may use custom fields. 
-- Even though we are joining to the INVOICES_CSTM table, we do not expect to return any data. 
-- 04/22/2008 Paul.  New invoices default to a stage of Due. 
-- 05/01/2009 Paul.  We want to be able to copy Orders custom fields to Invoices custom fields, 
-- so we must join to the ORDERS_CSTM table and just expect a matching set of fields in INVOICES_CSTM. 
-- 08/08/2009 Paul.  QUOTE_NUM, ORDER_NUM and INVOICE_NUM are all strings now.
-- 08/30/2009 Paul.  All module views must have a TEAM_SET_ID. 
-- 08/01/2010 Paul.  Add CREATED_BY_NAME and MODIFIED_BY_NAME so that we can display the full name in lists like Sugar. 
-- 10/25/2010 Paul.  TEAM_SET_LIST is needed by the RulesWizard. 
-- 03/31/2016 Paul.  Add DATE_MODIFIED_UTC. 
-- 11/30/2017 Paul.  Add ASSIGNED_SET_ID for Dynamic User Assignment. 
-- 02/04/2020 Paul.  Add Tags module.
