-- 09/09/2008 Paul.  Using a union causes a problem if there is an NTEXT custom field in the PROSPECTS_CSTM table. 
-- The text, ntext, or image data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT.
-- One solution would be to use UNION ALL, but then we would get duplicate records. 
-- So we still use UNION ALL, but also use an outer join to block duplicates.
