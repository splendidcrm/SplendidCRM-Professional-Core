-- 11/27/2006 Paul.  Add TEAM_ID.
-- 11/27/2006 Paul.  Return TEAM.ID so that a deleted team will return NULL even if a value remains in the related record. 
-- 03/01/2007 Paul.  The CITY and PHONE we return needs to be of the account, not of the parent. 
-- 08/30/2009 Paul.  All module views must have a TEAM_SET_ID, so use the ACCOUNTS value. 
-- 10/25/2010 Paul.  TEAM_SET_LIST is needed by the RulesWizard. 
-- 11/11/2012 Paul.  Return all account fields. 
-- 12/04/2012 Paul.  Change the view to make ACCOUNT_ID to be the PARENT_ID, which is consistent with all other relationship views. 
-- 12/04/2012 Paul.  It may seem odd to use ACCOUNT_ID as the name of the Parent ID, but that is the convention for relationship views. 
-- 11/30/2017 Paul.  Add ASSIGNED_SET_ID for Dynamic User Assignment.
