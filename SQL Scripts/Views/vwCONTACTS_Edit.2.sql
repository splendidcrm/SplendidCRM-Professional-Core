-- 02/09/2006 Paul.  SugarCRM uses the CONTACTS_USERS table to allow each user to 
-- choose the contacts they want sync'd with Outlook. 
-- This view requires that the USER_ID be set, otherwise too many records will be returned 
-- due to the CONTACTS_USERS join.
-- 03/06/2006 Paul.  The join to CONTACTS_USERS must occur external to the view. 
-- This is the only way to ensure that the record is always returned, with the sync flag set. 
-- 11/08/2008 Paul.  Move description to base view. 
-- 03/05/2009 Paul.  Add PORTAL_PASSWORD for Splendid Portal.  Sugar added it in 4.5.0. 
-- 08/19/2016 Paul.  Add support for Business Processes. 
-- 08/12/2021 Paul.  Add Machine Learning prediction fields.
