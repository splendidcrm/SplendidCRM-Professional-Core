-- 10/28/2007 Paul.  The include the email parent, but not union all so that duplicates will get filtered. 
-- 11/19/2007 Paul.  We must use union all because an ntext custom field will break the view.
-- The ultimate solution is to convert all ntext to nvarchar(max), but then we would need to drop support for SQL 2000. 
-- 09/09/2008 Paul.  Using a union causes a problem if there is an NTEXT custom field in the PROSPECTS_CSTM table. 
-- The text, ntext, or image data type cannot be selected as DISTINCT.
-- One solution would be to use UNION ALL, but then we would get duplicate records. 
-- So we still use UNION ALL, but also use an outer join to block duplicates. 
-- 11/30/2017 Paul.  Add ASSIGNED_SET_ID for Dynamic User Assignment.
