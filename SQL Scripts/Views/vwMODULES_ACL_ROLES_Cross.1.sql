-- 04/29/2006 Paul.  DB2 has a problem with cross joins, so place in a view so that it can easily be converted. 
-- 01/16/2010 Paul.  We need the table name so that we can get the ACL Fields for a module. 
Create View dbo.vwMODULES_ACL_ROLES_Cross
as
select MODULES.MODULE_NAME
     , MODULES.TABLE_NAME
     , MODULES.DISPLAY_NAME
     , MODULES.MODULE_ENABLED
     , MODULES.TAB_ENABLED
     , MODULES.TAB_ORDER
     , MODULES.IS_ADMIN
     , ACL_ROLES.ID           as ROLE_ID
  from      MODULES
 cross join ACL_ROLES
 where MODULES.DELETED = 0
   and ACL_ROLES.DELETED = 0

GO

Grant Select on dbo.vwMODULES_ACL_ROLES_Cross to public;
