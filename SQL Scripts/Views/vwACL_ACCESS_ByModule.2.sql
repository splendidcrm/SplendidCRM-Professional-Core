-- 04/26/2006 Paul.  Get the minimum ACLACCESS just in case vwACL_ACTIONS contains multiple records. 
-- Normally, we would use a unique index on the ACL_ACTIONS table, but we cannot because 
-- near identical rows are allowed because of the use of the DELETED flag. 
-- 12/05/2006 Paul.  iFrames should not be excluded because the My Portal tab can be disabled and edited. 
-- 02/03/2009 Paul.  Exclude Teams from role management. 
-- 03/09/2010 Paul.  Allow IS_ADMIN and Team Management so that they can be managed separately. 
-- 04/17/2016 Paul.  Allow Calendar to be disabled. 
-- 09/26/2017 Paul.  Add Archive access right. 
-- 01/11/2019 Paul.  Activities should not be excluded as started treating Activities separately on 06/02/2016.
